# Introduction

A decision-making matrix is, in essence, an elevated, quantified pro-con list. It is used when a single candidate needs to be chosen among multiple and there are factors in each candidate that need to be taken into account when making the decision. To use the matrix, enumerate each factor and assign it a numerical weight. For each candidate, give it a score for all the criteria. The best candidate will be the one with the highest total weighted score.

I like to use the example of a high school senior determining what college is the best choice for him. He would determine factors like cost, size, location/distance from home, course offerings, school colors, etc. and give them a weight proportional to how important each is (factors like cost and location would hopefully be weighted more than school colors). Then, he would give each college a score corresponding to each factor, sum the scores, and choose to attend the college with the highest score.

Note that the scales are somewhat arbitrary. While there are few constraints on what kind of numbers can be assigned to weights and scores, it is recommended that all candidates are scored on the same scale and the scale is not arbitrary.
